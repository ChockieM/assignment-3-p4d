            <div class="text"><p>Here we are considering the adverse effects of high intensity wildfires on the community and the environment. It should be remembered that it is not just intensity of a bushfire that matters. The extent of a bushfire is also very important. A large bushfire can cause multiple direct impacts: on life and property, on the survival of fauna populations, on water resources, and indirectly on government budgets and insurance costs. A large bushfire will also generate huge amounts of smoke.</p></div>

            <div class="text"><p>In severe fire seasons the damage caused by bushfires is astronomical. In the 2003 Canberra fire disaster, for example, the cost to insurers alone was $257 million (The West Australian, 13 Feb, 2003). The total cost of the fires, including the cost of suppression measures and lost productivity, would be much greater than this figure. Add to it the loss of life, personal trauma, loss of invaluable personal possessions and destruction of scientific equipment and data from the Mt Stromlo Observatory, and the ramifications of such disasters start to become apparent.</p></div>

            <div class="text"><p>Of course, the forests incinerated by these intense bushfires also suffer great damage. Unlike the usual description employed in the media, most native forests are not “destroyed” by wildfire. Some are. Ash-type eucalypt forests are killed in this way, as the 1939 Victorian fire disaster clearly demonstrated. Drier forest types, such as jarrah in WA are not destroyed, although they are severely damaged and many trees are killed by high intensity bushfires.</p></div>
