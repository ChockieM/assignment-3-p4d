Producer Notes

This was a very unexpectedly difficult task for me.
Having to combine html, css and js was just strangly hard to do. 

The elements I managed to include in my one page website are the following:
A table of contents.
A video background.
A title with a glitch effect.
A carusol using javascript.
A QR code using javascript. 
Pictures, and Paragraphs. 

This final semester of university has been very intense for me, 
and my lack of proper time management, and focus on other units has made
this website assignment not as good as I wouldve hoped for myself.

Im pleased with the elements and graphics that ive included, 
very happy with the aesthetic I managed to capture and
satisfied with the information I have presented in the website.
Although I know it could have been better. 

Learning has been had though. Even if my sub-par time management and 
apparant un-ability to wrap my head around certain js functions has 
casued me to deliver a website that seems simple, I still feel like
I have developed and achieved a much better understanding of js, html and css. 

to clear up any potential confusion because of my file names:
HTMLPage1.html = index.html
script.js = index.js
StyleSheet1.css = index.css
